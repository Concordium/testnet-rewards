### Update: work-in-progress reward status

We have almost completed reviews for people who submitted correctly (~80% total), and are now starting to look at duplicates, closed pull requests, and feedback on pending items.

<ins>**Please do not contact us about results yet**</ins> â€“ these results are not yet final. We will announce when the period for feedback commences.

If you think we've missed something on a rejected submission, please respond as a comment or a question on the related PR (all submissions below link back to Githhub PRs).

Rewards are calculated once for a successful submission, even if duplicates are confirmed.
